  // structures you may have created for CS200/CS250 (especially CS250). You
  // will likely not need to change this interface much, but you may need to
  // change TriangleMesh::Build in future assignments. Most of the changes you
  // will be doing to meshes will be the Vertex itself. See Vertex.h for more
  // information on how vertices work. TriangleMeshes are intended to be easy to
  // assemble, convert to a VertexArrayObject, and render. The sample main file
  // provided with this framework demonstrates how to build a triangle mesh in
