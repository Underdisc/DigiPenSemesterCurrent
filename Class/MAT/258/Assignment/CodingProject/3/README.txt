How to run this executable.
1. Double click the executable (prog.exe) and a command prompt will appear.
2. Type in the problem number and press enter. The problem numbers correspond directly to the instruction handout.

How to input values.
- There are four *.graph files for problems 1, 2, 3 and 4.
  - The first line of the file is the number of vertices.
  - The next lines are the adjacency matrix data.
- The file should look something like this.

// SOF //
4
0 3 1 0
3 0 7 1
1 7 0 0
0 1 0 0
// EOF //

- Just copy and past the adjacency matrix in this format and everything will work.
- The four graph files that came with this submission already have sample matrix data in them. Use them as a reference if needed.
