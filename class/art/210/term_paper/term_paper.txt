On Saturday, December 1st, I went to SODO with my father to find a piece of public art on the walls of SODO buildings. SODO is loaded with grafitti and street art and I saw it as the perfect place to find a piece of artwork to write about. While walking up and down the SODO Busway, I came across the piece that had the largest affect on me, {Escaping a Burning Culture} by Baso Fibonacci and Jean Nagai (2017).

Located on a building wall near the West Seattle Bridge, the painting depicts a wolf running from a background consumed by flames. The fire is almost entirely full of warm orange and red colours and it makes up a large majority of the piece. In fact, besides the bottom, the flames make up the entire background. The wolf starkly contrasts these falmes. It is not composed of shades of brown and black like one would expect. Instead, the wolf's form is created by strokes of different colors. Vibrant portions of the wolf contain cool blues, saturated yellows, and hints of dominant reds. Other patches on the animal are almost entirely a solid shade of blue. This wolf acts as the primary figure of the painting as it is the first place our eyes are drawn to investigate more. Below the wolf's body and fire, Fibonacci and Nagai decided to fill the rest of the surface with a pitch black, heavily contrasting with the rest of image.

There are many possible themes that this piece could be playing with. The obvious classification would be the natural world, but the piece does more than just paint a picture of nature. Instead, it communicates a story with a bit of imagination. The wolf is fleeing from the hot approaching fires in the background. From the piece, it is unclear what is being burned, but it is clear that it was where the wolf once resided. The fire is forcing the wolf to run away from the place it occupied because staying there would put the wolf in danger. Though it is not directly depicted, we could assume that this was the wolf's stomping grounds and this fire will force it away such that it will never return. A fire does not only create an immediate threat to the animal. It will also forever change the landscape that was once there. It will become a barren wasteland and the wolf would have no way to continue its way of life there once the flames subside. Due to these elements, it is clear that the painting is trying to present us with a story about something being ousted from a place using the long lasting effects of fire and the wolf's escape.

To achieve the depecition of this story, Fibonacci and Nagai make use of only a few visual elements to get the idea across. When first presented with the picture, one of our first questions is "Where is the wolf looking?" The wolf is not looking back at the fire. Instead, the implied line emerging from the wolf's eyes show it facing away and demonstrates its intent to move towards safety. Rather than just showing what the wolf wants to do, Fibonacci and Nagai make it clear that the wolf is already on its way out. Though showing the wolf in a running position would be enought, they take it a bit further with their texturing of the wolf. Its body is composed of hundreds of fur lines. Each of these are a single strock and vast majority show the wolf's fur being forced to the right as if under the effect of wind. This and the wolf's raised front legs show us the full image of a wolf in motion. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the color of the wolf's fur as it is a significant element of the piece. It's fur is almost entirely composed of cool colors, with some patches being tinted and others being heavily shaded. This demonstates more than just a depiction of the wolf. It is trying to the peacefulness of the where the wolf once inhabited. This idea is further elaborated upon when we notice the shaded red and dim yellow furs on some sections of the wolfs facade. These clearly share color with the fire in the background, possibly demonstrating that the wolf's fur is a reflection of the environment it lives in. A once serene place has burst into flames.
And on top of all of this, there is fire. The warm colors of the fire engulf the wolf, and their strong contrast represents the opposition between the two.


The contrast of the warm colors of the fire and the cool colors of the wolf.
The hints of red on the wolf's fur.
The shaded portions of the fur
The cool colors are what it was. The red hair is the effect of the fire on the wolf. The fire uses warm colors to show the force that is removing the wolf.



This is composition stuff
The direction the fire is moving and the direction the wolf is moving. They oppose eachother. maybe the wolf doesn't like how the fire thinks, so it leaves
Rythym of the wolf fur
Emphasis on the Wolf.

I come from California originally, though true description of this piece does not have to do with global warming and the rampant wild fires that tearing through California, it is the first thing that I though of. To me, it is such an important aspect of the modern day, that even after reading the description of what the art was supposed to represent, I refused to write about it because that is not what the piece communicated to me. When I saw it, I saw a wolf covered with color and diversity being driven away but a single burning mass that would soon leave the entire land barren. All of those colors in the wolf were more than just the wolf itself, it represented all of the nature that would be affected by the fire. Those large red flames forced all of the colour of that world to leave it behind. Perserving nature and this planet is something I care very deeply about. When my time is up, I would like to see a world where humans and nature exist as one. This piece reminded me that right now we are still forcing it out of our lives.
