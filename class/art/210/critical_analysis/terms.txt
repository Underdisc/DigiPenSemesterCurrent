Principles of Design
Composition - Organization of all visual elements.
Unity - Things belonging together.
Visual Unity - Similar visual elements.
Conceptual Unity - Grouping of ideas.
Variety - Differences that provide.
Visual Weight - apparent heaviness or lightness of forms in the composition.
Symmetrical Balance - Things are the same on both sides.
Approximate Symmetry - Things are similar on both sides, but there are differences.
Emphasis - Putting emphasis on an area so viewers look at it.
Focal Point - The center of the piece.
Subordination - Less visualy interesting.
Scale - Size in relation to normal size.
Proportion - Size relationships between parts.
Rythm - Repetition of visual elements.
