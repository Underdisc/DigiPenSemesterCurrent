Neither of the stories can really be considered feminist, but giving the time period the stories were written, the things that are said are somewhat just.

We have to be careful when we attempt to define these pieces as feminist or not. Though the pieces present societies that are not femenist, they turn the tables and put men into women's shoes in many regards. The societies created are not femenist, however, the goals of the essays are to further support feminism and close the gap that has existed between men and women. Not to completely overtake it and put society in favor of women.

Are these stories feminist or are they not? To answer this some distinctions need to be made. 

The works are definitely femenist pieces, but the societies that are portayed in the works are not femenist societies. In other words. The worlds created by both authors are not representitive of the goals of feminism. The goal of feminism is to develop a society in which men and women share equal power. A society in which being a man or women will have no bearing on one's success. A world in which the opposite sex does not view the other as lesser or greater than themselves. Trule, and equal world devoid of unjust sexism. These stories do not have such a society. Instead it is taken to the extreme. It is to the point where divide is so large that men and women no longer interact. This is not the goal of feminism. However, 

Thought these works take the divide to the extreme, they strive to show sexism at its greatest. They do this with the hope that readers will be aware of this gap and make sure that we close it.


72 and 73 is right around the time of Roe v. Wade. When it changed probably pulled a lot of inspiration from it.

- Men are pictured as vile beasts in the first story
- Quote it.
- If this piece was truly a feminist piece, the language would not be so negative. There would be more nutural language usage.
